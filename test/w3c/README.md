# Tests from W3C

This folder contains scripts to execute the tests described in [SCXML 1.0 Implementation Report](https://www.w3.org/Voice/2013/scxml-irp/).

## Download and Transform

__To download and transform call the bash script `download_and_transform_tests.sh`__ - _please check the requirements below_

The original tests are written in a data-model-agnostic way and
need a xsl transformation to (in this case) the ECMA-data-model.<br/>
W3C delivers a xsl-transformation for this case.

The Identifiers of the test are extracted from [https://www.w3.org/Voice/2013/scxml-irp/manifest.xml](https://www.w3.org/Voice/2013/scxml-irp/manifest.xml).
The script select all _mandatory_ and _automated_ txml-tests. Optional or manual tests are ignored.
The test files itself are downloaded from [https://www.w3.org/Voice/2013/scxml-irp/](https://www.w3.org/Voice/2013/scxml-irp/).

The script never downloads a file twice, to update to newer versions,
delete the folder `txml` and call `download_and_transform_tests.sh` again.

The xsl seems (afaik) to be usable only with [SAXON](https://github.com/Saxonica/Saxon-HE). The download script tries to download the open-source-version of SAXON
and call it to transform the W3C scripts. The transformed test are placed in the folder `scxml`.

### Requirements

+ __bash__ To execute the script. In MS-Windows you can use __wsl__.
+ __java__ (at least 1.9, check SAXON documention in case of issues)
+ __curl__ (to download SAXON and the test sources)
+ __unzip__ (to uncompress SAXON)
+ __xmllint__ (from `libxml2-utils`) to extract the matching tests from manifest.
+ Internet connection.

## Running the tests

After the tests are downloaded and transformed you can run them with the script
`execute_tests.sh`. <br/>
The script will execute all _*.scxml_ files in folder _scxml_.

It will print the progress to the console.
Output of the tests is redirected to files in sub-folder "logs".

The script needs a debug-build of the binary `test` in `target/release`.
You can build it with `cargo build --release`

The script writes also the Report-file, that is linked below.

## Current status
