# Finite State Machine (FSM) Implementation in Rust

[![Test Status](https://github.com/BWeng20/rFSM/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BWeng20/rFSM/actions/workflows/rust.yml) [![Rust-Slippy](https://github.com/BWeng20/rFSM/actions/workflows/rust-clippy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BWeng20/rFSM/actions/workflows/rust-clippy.yml)

According to W3C Recommendations, reading and executing State Chart XML (SCXML).

See https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/

Currently, the project passed all 160 of the mandatory automated tests from the W3C test-suite.<br/>
See [Test Readme](test/w3c/README.md) and the [Test Report](test/w3c/REPORT.MD).

## To-Dos:

+ Implement BasicHttpEvent I/O Processor _(ongoing, see [basic_http_event_io_processor.rs](src/basic_http_event_io_processor.rs))_.
+ Design a concept for dynamic binding of business-logic to the FSM (to do real things).

The trace options <i>Trace_xxx</i> still needed to be activated during runtime by settings the trace-mode.
If none of the <i>Trace_xxx</i> features are used, "Tracer" module is completely removed.

## Tracer

The Tracer module is planed to be used as remote monitor or test interface for events and transitions.<br/>
If not used, the code can be removed by the above feature-switches.

Currently, it simply prints the traced actions. 

## How To Use

FSMs normally are used embedded inside other software to control some state-full workflow.<br/> 
The operations of this workflow are triggered from the transitions or the states-handlers.  
To add such operations different approaches exits. In hard-coded FSMs, methods-calls are directly
linked to the transition or states during compile-time.<br/>

This implementation loads FSMs during runtime, so the binding needs to be dynamic.<br/> 

To add custom logic, you can use the module "Action". See the next chapters for details.<br/>

For some huge project, it may also be feasible to implement a specialized Datamodel and implement logic directly there.<br/>


### Datamodel

The Datamodel in SCXML is responsible to execute code and expressions. The actual business logic of a FSM is implemented this way. 
For details about the Datamodel-concept in SCXML see the W3C documentation.<br/>

This lib provides an implementation of the EMCAScript-Datamodel, but you can implement other models as well.<br/>
If your FSM only needs simple logic and communicates only with the build-in "send", there is not need to extend the Datamodel.

But if you need special stuff, you can implement a new datamodel. You can have multiple datamodels in you runtime and select one in the SCXML document of the FSM instance.<br/>
To add new data-models, use function `rfsm::fsm::register_datamodel`.

This way you have full control about our datamodel-language and business-logic.

If you are basically fine which the language and features of one of the available Datamodels, but you need special function to call, you can do this by adding "Custom Actions" as described below. 
The actions can then be called from the existing Datamodel-language.


### Custom Actions

You can use the trait "Action" to add custom functions to the FSM. See the Examples for a How-To.
Each FSM instance can have some different set of Actions. Action are inherited by child-session.

If using ECMAScript, these actions can be called like normal methods. Arguments and return values will be converted 
from and to JavaScript values. See enum "Data" for supported data-types.

Actions have full access to the data and states of the FSM.
