# Finite State Machine (FSM) Implementation in Rust

[![Test Status](https://github.com/BWeng20/rFSM/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BWeng20/rFSM/actions/workflows/rust.yml) [![Rust-Slippy](https://github.com/BWeng20/rFSM/actions/workflows/rust-clippy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BWeng20/rFSM/actions/workflows/rust-clippy.yml)

According to W3C Recommendations, reading and executing State Chart XML (SCXML).

See https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/

Currently, the project passed all 160 of the mandatory automated tests from the W3C test-suite.<br/>
See [Test Readme](test/w3c/README.md) and the [Test Report](test/w3c/REPORT.MD).

## To-Dos:

+ Implement BasicHttpEvent I/O Processor _(ongoing, see [basic_http_event_io_processor.rs](src/basic_http_event_io_processor.rs))_.
+ Design a concept for dynamic binding of business-logic to the FSM (to do real things).

The trace options <i>Trace_xxx</i> still needed to be activated during runtime by settings the trace-mode.
If none of the <i>Trace_xxx</i> features are used, "Tracer" module is completely removed.

[^1]: If any of the "Trace_XXXX" features is turned on, the release build will get ~ 0.03 MiB larger. 

## Tracer

The Tracer module can be used to monitor events and transitions.<br/>

The default-tracer simply prints the traced actions. If the Remote-Trace-Server is activated, the default-tracer is 
replaced by a tracer that communicates via the Remote-Trace-Server with some remote-client.   

## How To Use

FSMs normally are used embedded inside other software to control some state-full workflow.<br/> 
The operations of this workflow are triggered from the transitions or the states-handlers.  
To add such operations different approaches exits. In hard-codes FSMs methods-calls are directly
linked to the transition or states during compile-time.<br/>

This implementation loads FSMs during runtime, so the binding needs to be dynamically.<br/> 

Form some huge project, you can re-implement to Datamodel-trait and implement an optimized way to trigger you 
functionality.<br/>
Must simpler is to use the module "Action". You find examples how to use this.

### Datamodel

For details about the Datamodel-concept in SCXML see the W3C documentation.<br/>
This lib provides some implementations of the Datamodel, but you can implement
other models as well.

The Datamodel in SCXML is responsible to execute code and expressions. Custom business logic
can be implemented this way. For a simpler approach (without implement a full Datamodel), see 
"Custom Actions" below.

The Datamodel is selected in the SCXML, so you can provide multiple model-implementation in
one binary.

To add new data-models, use function `rfsm::fsm::register_datamodel`.

### Provided Datamodel Implementations

+ EMCAScript-Datamodel, use `datamodel="ecmascript"`. Available if feature _"ECMAScript"_ is turned on.
+ The Null-Datamodel, use `datamodel="null"`
+ Internal Expression Engine Datamodel, use `datamodel="rfsm-expression"`. Available if feature _"RfsmExpressionModel"_ is turned on.

As the EMCAScript-Datamodel is based on boa-engine, it results in a huge binary. 
If you need only basic logic in your scripts, use "rfsm-expression" instead.

### Custom Actions

You can use the trait "Action" to add custom functions to the FSM. See the Examples for a How-To.
Each FSM instance can have a different set of Actions. Action are inherited by child-sessions.

If using ECMAScript- or RfsmExpressions-Datamodel, these actions can be called like normal methods. 
Arguments and return values will be converted from and to JavaScript/Data-values. See enum "Data" for supported data-types.

Actions have full access to the data and states of the FSM.
