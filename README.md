# Finite State Machine Implementation in RUST

According to W3C Recommendations

See https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/

To-Do:

+ Implement XML-Reading _(ongoing)_
+ Parallel implement the model (fsm, states etc.) _(mostly finished)_
+ Implement Datastructures needed (Queue etc.) _(mostly finished)_
+ Implement methods in the model _(ongoing, much work to do)_
+ Design concept for "invoke"
    + Life-cycle control of threads / processes.
    + Communication: See Cancel-methods. <br>
      We can use events via external-queue, but spec doesn't force this.
+ Repair schema... (still some reds) _(not started)_
